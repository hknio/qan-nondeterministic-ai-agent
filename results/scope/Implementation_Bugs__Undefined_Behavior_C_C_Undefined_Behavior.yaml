  Buffer Overflows & Memory Corruption.
  Writing beyond allocated memory (e.g., array out-of-bounds) may corrupt adjacent data or control structures. Different runs or compiler optimizations can manifest these corruptions in unpredictable ways, potentially causing crashes or inconsistent outputs.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Allocate several buffers in a tight loop, write slightly out of bounds, then read from neighboring buffers and print checksums.
  - Idea 2: Randomize the order of allocations/frees, then intentionally perform an out-of-bounds write to see if corruption changes a final aggregated hash.
  - Idea 3: Repeatedly perform boundary checks with an “off-by-one” error in a critical loop and log whether the loop ever produces unexpected values.
  - Idea 4: Use multi-threading (even on one CPU) where one thread does out-of-bounds writes while another continuously reads a shared structure. Compare final structure checksums across multiple runs.
  - Idea 5: Vary the size of the allocated arrays at runtime and see if the resulting output hash changes unexpectedly between runs or servers.

  Use of Uninitialized Variables.
  Reading uninitialized memory may return “garbage” data leftover from prior stack or heap usage. Compilers can also optimize code in ways that expose or hide these reads differently across runs.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Create a program that intentionally declares large local arrays without initialization, then sums their contents and prints a single hash result.
  - Idea 2: Randomize the calling order of functions that each have uninitialized local variables, then compare final outputs for each permutation.
  - Idea 3: Allocate a large heap buffer, partially initialize it, and read from uninitialized regions—print checksums of those regions to see if runs differ.
  - Idea 4: Use a minimal multi-thread approach where thread A allocates memory but only partially initializes it, and thread B immediately reads it. Print both threads’ results.
  - Idea 5: Force different optimization levels (`-O0`, `-O2`) within the same container (if allowed) to see if the program output changes due to the compiler handling of uninitialized variables.

  Dangling Pointers & Use-After-Free.
  Accessing memory after it’s freed can sometimes “appear” to work or cause silent corruption. The behavior can vary drastically depending on memory allocator state, thread interleavings, and optimization.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Allocate a structure, free it, then immediately allocate a new object of similar size. Print checksums of the new object to see if leftover data from the old object appears.
  - Idea 2: Use multiple threads where one frees a buffer while another tries to read it. Compare final outputs or detect crashes across repeated runs.
  - Idea 3: Randomize the order of large vs. small allocations, forcing the allocator to reuse memory regions quickly, then read from a freed pointer.
  - Idea 4: Insert deliberate delays (e.g., a short busy loop) between free and read in a single-thread scenario to see if it alters final results.
  - Idea 5: Maintain a log of pointer addresses and their contents before/after free. Check if differences appear across repeated executions.

  Type Punning & Strict Aliasing Violations.
  Reinterpreting a memory region of one type as a different type without using safe approaches (e.g., `memcpy`, unions) breaks strict aliasing rules. Optimizers might produce code that assumes no aliasing occurs, leading to unpredictable behavior.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Create a test that casts a `float*` to an `int*` in a loop, modifies the data in one pointer, and reads from the other. Compare final numeric outputs across runs.
  - Idea 2: Use a union vs. raw pointer casting to see if results differ in a simple series of computations.
  - Idea 3: Compile two versions of the same code: one with `-fno-strict-aliasing` and one with default flags. Compare the final printed checksums.
  - Idea 4: Insert artificially complex expressions to encourage aggressive compiler optimizations, then print intermediate results at each step to detect differences.
  - Idea 5: Try punning structures of different sizes or alignment constraints, then observe if printing field values produces inconsistent outputs in repeated runs.

  Data Races in C/C++.
  Even in a single virtual CPU environment, threads can be time-multiplexed. Unprotected shared data access can lead to unpredictable read/write interleavings, causing different results across runs.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Have two threads increment a shared counter without a lock in a tight loop. Print the counter at the end to see if final values differ across runs.
  - Idea 2: Use a shared boolean flag toggled by one thread while another thread checks its value in a loop, logging every transition.
  - Idea 3: Introduce a short randomized sleep (e.g., CPU busy-wait for microseconds) in one thread to shift scheduling patterns slightly and see if final outputs vary.
  - Idea 4: Combine multiple shared variables with partial locking to see if partial synchronization leads to race conditions that alter final aggregated results.
  - Idea 5: Compare the results of the same code compiled with and without memory barriers or atomic operations, checking if outputs remain consistent.

  Invalid Shift Operations, Alignment Violations, etc..
  Shifting integers by more bits than their width or performing misaligned memory accesses can yield undefined results in C/C++. On x86, misalignment might be tolerated but can still cause performance or subtle correctness differences, especially under optimization.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Run a loop that deliberately shifts an integer by an out-of-range amount, printing the result for each iteration.
  - Idea 2: Access a structure misaligned on purpose (e.g., via a packed struct) and print out the fields in a loop, checking for unexpected anomalies.
  - Idea 3: Compare two programs: one with normal alignment, one that forces misalignment using `#pragma pack`. Check if final outputs ever diverge.
  - Idea 4: Insert instructions that rely on SSE or AVX loads of data not aligned to 16 or 32 bytes, then print checksums of the loaded data.
  - Idea 5: Randomize the alignment of allocated memory by adjusting offsets before use. Collect final computations in a checksum to detect differences.
