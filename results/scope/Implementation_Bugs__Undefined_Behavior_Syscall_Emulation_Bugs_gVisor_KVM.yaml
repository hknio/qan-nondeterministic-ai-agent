  Incomplete or Inconsistent Syscall Coverage.
  gVisor emulates many syscalls in userspace, potentially leaving edge cases or less common syscalls only partially supported. Return values or `errno` might differ from native Linux behaviors.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Invoke a suite of uncommon syscalls or `ioctl`s with borderline parameters. Print each call’s return code and `errno`.
  - Idea 2: Stress-test concurrency for a syscall that is known to be partially emulated (e.g., advanced namespace or scheduling calls). Log final statuses in a repeated loop.
  - Idea 3: Attempt extreme resource usage (within 1024 MB limit) to see if memory-related syscalls fail or behave unexpectedly, then print the results.
  - Idea 4: Compare the observed behavior of a specific syscall in gVisor vs. a native Linux environment (if accessible). Print any differences in return codes.
  - Idea 5: Try calling syscalls in a random sequence with random arguments. Log all return values in a structured format and compare across repeated runs.

  Emulated Scheduling Differences.
  gVisor’s scheduling might not precisely mirror the host kernel’s. Threads or blocking syscalls could be handled differently, revealing subtle concurrency issues.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Have multiple threads performing blocking reads on pipes or sockets. Log the order in which they are unblocked, comparing across runs.
  - Idea 2: Use a high volume of short-lived threads that do minimal work, capturing final thread completion order or times in a printed log.
  - Idea 3: Include random `sched_yield` calls in a multi-thread program to see if gVisor scheduling produces different interleavings from run to run.
  - Idea 4: Repeatedly run a simple server/client pattern in the container (if networking is allowed within the container) to see if acceptance order changes.  
  - Idea 5: Force CPU-bound tasks plus I/O-bound tasks in the same program. Compare final aggregated performance logs or result ordering across multiple runs.

  Virtualized Resource Limits.
  Although memory is capped at 1024 MB and CPU is restricted to 1 core, the internal resource tracking in gVisor can introduce subtle race conditions or inconsistent behaviors when near these limits.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Allocate close to the 1024 MB limit, then spawn an additional thread that also tries to allocate memory. Print success/failure statuses and see if they differ across runs.
  - Idea 2: Continuously open and close file descriptors until reaching a limit. Log the point of failure or error codes for each run.
  - Idea 3: Run a tight CPU-bound loop for ~4 seconds, then attempt a heavy memory operation. Compare how gVisor prioritizes or interrupts tasks.
  - Idea 4: Approach the memory limit in small increments, printing each allocation’s success. Compare final allocations possible in repeated runs.
  - Idea 5: Spin up multiple processes (if permitted within the container) that collectively approach the memory or FD limit. Log the final resource usage and any errors.

  Version or Host-Specific Behaviors.
  Different blockchain nodes might run slightly different gVisor or host kernel versions. Minor changes in emulation logic, CPU microcode, or hardware could surface as differences in syscall results or timing.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Gather a “feature fingerprint” (e.g., /proc/cpuinfo, if accessible, or a minimal feature detection program) and print it. Compare across nodes to see differences.
  - Idea 2: Run a suite of small tests that check various syscalls’ behaviors and collect them into a single hash. Compare the hash across servers.
  - Idea 3: Perform repeated floating-point or concurrency tests on each host, looking for divergences that might map to CPU microcode differences.
  - Idea 4: If multiple gVisor versions exist, run the same binary in each environment and compare logs for any discrepancies in return codes or error messages.
  - Idea 5: Stress test timing or scheduling by measuring how long a specific syscall takes in a loop, printing an aggregated statistic. Differences might indicate host-specific quirks.
