  Multi-threaded Library Calls.
  Shared internal data structures (e.g., malloc metadata, stdio buffers) can be modified concurrently by multiple threads. Even on one CPU, time slicing may lead to data races or inconsistent states.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Start several threads that repeatedly call `malloc`/`free` in random sequences. Collect final memory usage or a checksum of allocated blocks.
  - Idea 2: Have multiple threads printing to `stdout` in quick succession. Capture output lines to see if they ever interleave or get corrupted.
  - Idea 3: Stress-test shared library calls like `strtok` or `gmtime` that are known to have non-thread-safe variants. Print final parsed results.
  - Idea 4: Insert random short sleeps after library calls in each thread to shift scheduling order, logging the final aggregated result.
  - Idea 5: Use a shared global object that’s updated by multiple threads with partial synchronization (e.g., one thread locks, another doesn’t). Print a final consistency check.

  Signal Handling Races.
  Signals can arrive at any time relative to a thread’s execution. Handling the signal may interrupt library or user code, causing reentrancy issues or data corruption if not carefully managed.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Set up a `SIGALRM` to fire periodically (e.g., every 1 second). In the handler, modify a global counter. In the main thread, read it in a loop and print the final value.
  - Idea 2: Use `SIGUSR1` to interrupt a multi-threaded program performing I/O. Log the point at which the signal is handled to see if any partial I/O occurs.
  - Idea 3: Install different signal handlers for multiple signals. Randomly raise them in tight loops. Print out which signals were handled in which order.
  - Idea 4: Test library calls that are not async-signal-safe (e.g., `printf`) inside a signal handler, capturing whether it leads to garbled output or differences across runs.
  - Idea 5: Use a small program that intentionally sends signals at random intervals to test how gVisor handles them under load, comparing final logs.

  Initialization Races.
  Many libraries perform lazy initialization of internal data (e.g., the first call to `pthread_create`, `dlopen`, or certain stdlib routines). The order or timing of initialization can differ, potentially causing inconsistent behavior.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: In multiple threads, call library functions that require lazy initialization (e.g., first call to a math library routine). Print timestamps or counters when each thread completes.
  - Idea 2: Repeatedly create/destroy threads quickly to force repeated initialization/teardown, logging any errors or anomalies in the output.
  - Idea 3: Use `dlopen` (if available) to load a small shared library in parallel threads. Print a final load/unload count to detect inconsistent states.
  - Idea 4: Make calls to system-level or library-level singletons (like `getenv`, `locale` setup) from multiple threads. Print the final environment or locale settings.
  - Idea 5: Introduce short random delays before and after each initialization call in each thread to see if the final program output differs across runs.

  I/O Buffering & Internal Caches.
  Standard I/O routines often buffer data. If multiple writes occur close together or if flush calls aren’t strictly managed, the final ordering or content can vary.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Idea 1: Write to `stdout` without explicit flushing in multiple threads and compare the exact interleaved lines of output.
  - Idea 2: Force partial writes (e.g., writing small chunks in a loop) while toggling line-buffered vs. fully-buffered modes, then collect and compare the final output.
  - Idea 3: Access large files in random read patterns (if a file system is permitted) and measure how the library’s caching might change the read sequence or final result.
  - Idea 4: Use `setvbuf` to alter buffering strategies. Compare how quickly data appears in `stdout` for repeated runs.
  - Idea 5: Simulate a flush race by calling `fflush` in a signal handler while another thread is actively writing. Compare final logs for anomalies.
