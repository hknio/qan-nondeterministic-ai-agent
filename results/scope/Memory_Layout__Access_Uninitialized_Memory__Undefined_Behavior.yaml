  Uninitialized Variables.
  Reading uninitialized variables can return leftover bits from prior stack or heap usage. Different runs or different memory states can lead to inconsistent values, producing nondeterministic outputs.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Uninitialized Stack Usage  
    Declare a large local array without initializing it and print its contents. Different bits across runs indicate nondeterminism.
  - Partially Initialized Struct  
    Allocate a struct but only initialize some fields; print all fields. Uninitialized fields can vary in value between runs.
  - Compiler Optimization Variation  
    Compile a test program at different optimization levels (`-O2`, `-O3`) that reads an uninitialized variable; watch for unpredictable outputs.
  - Multiple Consecutive Runs  
    Execute the same binary repeatedly in a loop and compare outputs. If uninitialized values differ, nondeterminism is present.
  - Compare with Zeroed Memory  
    Run one version that explicitly zeroes memory and another that leaves it uninitialized. If only the uninitialized version shows random results, that confirms the source of nondeterminism.

  Use-After-Free / Dangling Pointers.
  Once memory is freed, the same region can be reallocated for different purposes. A dangling pointer referencing freed memory can see unpredictable data if that memory block is reused differently across runs.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Allocate/Free/Reallocate  
    Rapidly allocate a buffer, free it, then allocate a new buffer and print its content. Stale data indicates use-after-free.
  - Simulate Different Execution Paths  
    Use random branches or user input to vary the order of allocations/frees. If reading from freed memory yields different results, that’s nondeterminism.
  - Stress Test with Threads  
    Even on a single CPU, multiple threads doing concurrent `malloc`/`free` may show different reuse patterns for freed memory.
  - Access Freed Local Variables  
    Return a pointer to a local variable from a function (incorrect usage). Compare its contents across runs to see if it changes unpredictably.
  - Library Hooks  
    Override `malloc`/`free` to detect or log accesses to freed blocks. If the program prints “detected invalid access” inconsistently, it indicates nondeterministic use-after-free behavior.
