  Single-Event Upsets (SEUs).
  Rare bit flips in memory or CPU registers/cache due to cosmic rays can change instructions or data at random, causing unpredictable results.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Repeated Summation Test  
    Continuously sum a large array of integers and print the final sum each iteration. A bit flip could cause occasional, unexpected deviations.
  - Iterative Hash Checker  
    Repeatedly hash a random block of data (e.g., using SHA-256) and compare to a known reference output. Any mismatch suggests a possible bit flip.
  - Fibonacci Stress  
    Continuously compute Fibonacci numbers in a loop, verifying each result. Print anomalies to stdout if any sequence term is incorrect.
  - Prime Sieve Validation  
    Run a prime sieve (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes) with a known correct result. Print the count of found primes each time. Unexpected variation indicates potential memory corruption.
  - Matrix Multiplication Check  
    Multiply fixed matrices with a known correct result. Print any discrepancies compared to the expected output.

  ECC Memory Corrections.
  ECC memory can correct or log errors in ways that introduce sporadic delays or pauses. Deferred error reporting can also trigger errors at unpredictable times.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Synthetic ECC Error Injection Simulation  
    Simulate ECC “alerts” by occasionally corrupting data blocks in memory and checking for corrections. Print whenever a correction is detected.
  - High-Frequency Write/Read Loop  
    Rapidly write random data to a large memory buffer, then read it back. Print any discrepancies to stdout.
  - Interrupt Timing Logger  
    Continuously measure time deltas between loops. Unusual pauses might correlate with ECC corrections or interrupts, which the program logs.
  - Threshold-Based Error Buildup  
    Maintain a large buffer and inject small corruptions. Print output when a simulated “ECC threshold” is reached, revealing deferred error reporting behavior.
  - ECC Event Stress  
    Generate heavy memory load (large allocations/frees). Log any unexpected slowdown or error pattern indicative of ECC corrections.
