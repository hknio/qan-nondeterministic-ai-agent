  Intentional Side-Channel.
  Contracts can exploit cache timing, speculation, or other microarchitectural features to communicate data covertly or observe hidden states, creating unexpected timing variations.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Cache Prime & Probe Test  
    Prime cache lines, then measure access times to detect “stray” use. Print timing differences that might suggest side-channel activity.
  - Speculation Timing Monitor  
    Run instructions designed to reveal speculative execution artifacts (e.g., Spectre-like tests). Print any measurable timing differences that indicate data leakage.
  - Branch Misprediction Counter  
    Generate many mispredictions via indirect branching. Print average misprediction resolution times to detect unusual patterns (possible side-channel usage).
  - Noise Injection  
    Run a background process that accesses memory randomly while the main process measures its own cache hits/misses. Print the range of variation to detect covert signals.
  - Network Stack Timing  
    Repeatedly send and receive loopback datagrams, measuring latencies. Print irregular spikes which could indicate side-channel interference via networking buffers.
