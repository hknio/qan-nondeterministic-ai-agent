  Kernel / gVisor Upgrades.
  Updating the host kernel or gVisor mid-run can change syscall implementations, scheduling, or resource behavior. Even minor library changes can alter function outputs or error codes.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Syscall Fingerprint Test  
    Enumerate a set of syscalls in a loop (open, read, write, etc.) and print their return codes. Changes after an update may reveal differences.
  - Version Info Snapshot  
    Continuously query system version data (`/proc/version`) and print it. If a kernel/gVisor upgrade occurs, the reported version may change unexpectedly.
  - Dynamic Library Injection  
    Dynamically load shared libraries and print function addresses/outputs. Changes in these values may signal an upgrade or library modification.
  - Stable ABI Stress  
    Call a set of stable syscalls repeatedly (e.g., `uname()`, `time()`) and compare outputs. Any format or return-value change could indicate an update.
  - Hot Patch Reaction  
    Continuously measure performance of a fixed workload. Print deviations in timing that might coincide with a hot patch applied to the kernel.

  Host Power Management.
  Power management mechanisms (C-states, SMIs, thermal throttling, dynamic frequency scaling) can pause or slow the CPU, causing irregular execution times.
  Some of test propositions:
  - Clock Drift Measurer  
    Repeatedly perform a known task and measure its duration using high-resolution timers. Print any spikes or anomalies in the timing results.
  - Thermal Load Generator  
    Run CPU-intensive tasks and track real-time performance metrics (e.g., operations per second). Print dips in performance if thermal throttling kicks in.
  - Sleep Duration Checker  
    Call `sleep(1)` (or similar) in a loop, measuring actual elapsed time. Print large deviations that might indicate deep sleep states or SMIs.
  - DFS Detection  
    Continuously read CPU frequency (if available) or measure a known computation loop. Print frequency changes or computation speed changes to detect dynamic scaling.
  - Interrupt Storm Simulation  
    Generate rapid I/O interrupts (e.g., via frequent filesystem operations). Print latencies or stalls to see if SMIs or power management triggers irregular pauses.
