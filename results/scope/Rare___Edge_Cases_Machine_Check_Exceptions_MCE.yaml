  Hardware Fault Detection.
  Machine Check Exceptions (MCE) happen when the CPU detects internal errors (e.g., cache parity). Handling may interrupt or halt processes unpredictably.
  Some of test propositions:
  - MCE Logging Poll  
    Continuously read and print MCE logs (if accessible) in a loop. Any new entry indicates a hardware-detected fault.
  - Hardware Stress  
    Perform CPU-heavy tasks (e.g., prime factorization) and watch for MCE logs or unexpected halts. Print progress counters or error messages if a fault occurs.
  - Cache Overload  
    Rapidly flush and refill caches with large data sets, checking for corruption. Print any anomalies in data verification.
  - Binary Search for Errors  
    Test small segments of memory in a tight loop, printing offsets of any detected corruption or MCE-like signals.
  - Recovery vs. Crash Detector  
    Push system to extremes (e.g., memory overcommit, CPU heat) and detect if an MCE is handled gracefully or causes a crash. Print final status or error codes.
