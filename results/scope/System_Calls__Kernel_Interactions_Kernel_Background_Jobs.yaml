  Memory Reclamation Scheduling.
  `kswapd` and `kcompactd` wake up under varying conditions (e.g., memory pressure) to reclaim or compact memory. The exact timing can cause minor differences in how allocations or I/O calls behave.
  Some of test propositions:
  1. Near-Limit Allocation Loop  
     - Continuously allocate memory to approach 1024MB, then free chunks.  
     - Print any slowdown or allocation failures that occur sporadically.
  2. Repeated `malloc` / `free`  
     - Rapidly allocate/free objects in different sizes to trigger compaction.  
     - Compare how many allocations succeed quickly vs. those that take longer.
  3. High I/O with Memory Pressure  
     - Perform large file writes or reads while also allocating memory.  
     - Output how often I/O slows or partial writes occur when memory reclaim triggers.
  4. Monitoring `/proc/meminfo`  
     - In a loop, read `/proc/meminfo` to see if reclaim activity (e.g., `Active(file)`) spikes.  
     - Log any correlation with slower or failed allocations.
  5. Variable Sleep  
     - Insert random sleeps in between bursts of allocation so the kernel might reclaim differently each run.  
     - Compare memory usage patterns across runs.

  RCU Grace Period Enforcement.
  RCU threads periodically check if a grace period ended to free or update data. This timing may shift slightly each run, affecting visibility of kernel data or freeing time.
  Some of test propositions:
  1. RCU Update & Read  
     - Continuously create data structures that rely on RCU (like ephemeral sockets or inodes), then read them.  
     - Print if old data lingers in any read unexpectedly.
  2. Forced Quiescent States  
     - Trigger context switches or sleeps to provoke grace period completions.  
     - Compare how quickly the kernel finalizes RCU callbacks across runs.
  3. Frequent Small Updates  
     - Make repeated minimal changes to a kernel structure (like opening/closing a single file).  
     - Output if read operations reflect intermediate states at different times.
  4. RCU Callback Counters  
     - If debugging is possible, read kernel counters for RCU callbacks (in `/proc` if exposed).  
     - Track how many callbacks have fired at identical points in repeated runs.
  5. Stress with Additional Load  
     - Run a CPU-bound or I/O-bound process to see if it delays RCU callback execution.  
     - Print the difference in callback timing or updated data detection.

  Writeback Daemons.
  Background daemons flush dirty pages to disk at intervals. Whether data is still in cache or forcibly written can affect read times or partial results for subsequent reads.
  Some of test propositions:
  1. Dirty Page Flood  
     - Write large amounts of data to a file repeatedly.  
     - Print how many write operations are still “dirty” after 5 seconds.
  2. Flush Timing Check  
     - Use `fsync` in a tight loop after each write.  
     - Compare runs to see if the writeback daemon triggers differently, impacting performance.
  3. Observe `/proc/vmstat`  
     - Continuously read `nr_dirty` or `nr_writeback` counters.  
     - Print changes to see if they spike or subside at random intervals across runs.
  4. Small vs. Large Writes  
     - Alternate tiny writes with big (e.g., 50MB) writes, forcing the daemon to handle them differently.  
     - Output the time from write completion to actual flush (if trackable).
  5. Interleaved Read/Write  
     - In parallel, read from the same file while writing to it.  
     - Print if read sees partial or inconsistent data under different flush timings.

  Scheduler Maintenance.
  The kernel runs housekeeping tasks such as load balancing (even if minimal on a single CPU), cgroup management, or frequency scaling (if enabled), which can occur at slightly different times and cause small scheduling shifts.
  Some of test propositions:
  1. Periodic Load Checking  
     - Continuously read `/proc/loadavg` while running a CPU-bound task.  
     - Print any unexpected peaks or troughs in load that differ run-to-run.
  2. Cgroup Manipulations  
     - If allowed, create/destroy cgroups or move the process among them.  
     - Log how that changes CPU scheduling metrics (like `schedstat`).
  3. CPU Frequency Scaling  
     - If enabled, stress the CPU, then idle, then stress again; measure the time to ramp up or down.  
     - Print differences in performance or measured speed.
  4. Intermittent CPU-bound & I/O-bound  
     - Alternate a loop of CPU usage with bursts of disk I/O.  
     - Print iteration counts or throughput to see if the scheduler changes priorities unpredictably.
  5. Scheduler Tick Variation  
     - Force many context switches with short sleeps in a loop.  
     - Print how many times a second the scheduler tick increments or yields.

  Entropy Gathering / RNG.
  Even if the environment claims a fixed initial state, the kernel might still gather entropy from hardware or internal events, causing `/dev/urandom` or other RNG sources to produce different outputs.
  Some of test propositions:
  1. Small Reads from `/dev/urandom`  
     - Immediately after container start, read a few bytes from `/dev/urandom` and print them in hex.  
     - Compare across runs to see if they differ.
  2. Repeated Reads  
     - Perform many repeated short reads from `/dev/urandom`.  
     - Log any changes in the sequence across runs.
  3. Stress + RNG  
     - While running CPU/memory stress, read random data.  
     - Print if the generated data differs from a baseline (if truly fixed, it should not).
  4. Check Entropy Counters  
     - If accessible, read `/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail` in a loop.  
     - Record how quickly it rises/falls in repeated runs.
  5. Compare Before/After Certain Operations  
     - Read random data, then do I/O or memory tasks, then read again.  
     - Print differences to see if these tasks somehow replenish the entropy pool differently.
